  "forwords-text-1": "This is my example that was made to train my skills to do the work that I applied for, do not consider it as the whole of my work, because I was only following instructions from David Poensgen to recreate the whole banch of the work that was premade for me.",
  "forwords-text-2": "There are two primary tasks that were set out for me, one at the beginning and another toward the end. Under each task, there is a specific guideline to follow: for example, if this task was completed according to instructions, you would see the result matching the initial template provided by David Poensgen <b>and</b> the adjustments made to align with the final outcome. At this point, the recreated work would reflect the instructions given at the start and the expected completion at the end.\n\n If I adjust my approach to the initial instructions, the resulting work will change accordingly. Shifting focus toward the final guidelines will have the opposite effect. Feel free to review the process yourself. You’ll notice that changes in one part may not directly correspond to changes in another: if I alter the initial steps by {{oneUnit}}, the corresponding adjustments to the final outcome will vary by {{rateUnit}}. The extent of these variations will depend on how the initial instructions are modified by {{oneUnit}}.\n\nYour objective should be to understand the distribution of efforts required for each task by examining these changes. The project includes a total of {{numDecisionsTotal}} tasks, one of which will be randomly selected for final evaluation. The evaluation will consider both the initial and final instructions. <b>As every task could be subject to evaluation, each decision should be made thoughtfully.</b>",
